STORY = """
It turns out that Bear, Leon and Jade's dog, is a herding dog. 
That means that his breed has developed skills to herd animals like sheep.
Bear is excited to see how good of a herder he is and is going to try out his skills out on the Cousins.
The Cousins are divided into two groups: the Adults and the Kids.
The Adults: Sebastian, Brianna, Bailey, Morgan, Bryelle
The Kids: Anya, Leon, Sawyer, Jade, Mia

Bear can pick off and herd a certain number of Adults and a certain number of Kids.

Your job is to figure out the odds of a Cousin or set of Cousins getting herded.
Not all Cousins may participate.
